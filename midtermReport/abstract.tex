\section{Abstract}
Advanced Persistent Threat(APT) attacks have plagued even well-protected businesses with significant financial losses. These attacks are complicated and stealthy, which can remain undetected for years. Therefore, enterprises are seeking solution to reconstruct the multiple steps of these sophisticated attack. We purpose a solution to automatically reconstruct the steps of APT. This solution includes: $\left(1\right)$ ubiquitous system monitoring for collecting the attack provenance for a long period of time and $\left(2\right)$ dependency analysis for causally connecting the dots of multiple steps of APT and $\left(3\right)$ reconstruct the attack step from the dependency analysis. Although there are several kernel audit frame for Linux and Windows and algorithms to reconstruct the dependency graph based on the audit frame output, it still relies heavily on security analysts to reconstruct steps of APT. The main contribution of this project is that adopting PageRank to requirement $\left(3\right)$ make it is possible to automatically reconstruct the process of APT.
